1. **Description** - Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact** - What could an attacker potentially do?
3. **Steps to Reproduce** - Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Proof of Concept** - Code or screenshots if applicable
5. **Suggested Fix** - If you have ideas for fixing it (optional)
6. **Your Contact Info** - So we can follow up with questions

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using this toolkit:

1. **Never commit secrets**:
   - Keep `.env` files local (already in `.gitignore`)
   - Don't hardcode API keys or tokens in scripts
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data

2. **Token security**:
   - `schemas/token.json` is gitignored - keep it that way
   - Tokens expire - refresh them regularly
   - Don't share tokens between environments

3. **OAuth security**:
   - Use PKCE flow (already implemented in scripts)
   - Keep client secrets secure
   - Use appropriate OAuth scopes

4. **Server configuration**:
   - Always use HTTPS for server endpoints
   - Validate server certificates
   - Configure CORS appropriately

5. **Dependencies**:
   - Keep dependencies updated: `npm outdated`
   - Review security advisories: `npm audit`
   - Use `package-lock.json` for reproducible builds

## Known Security Considerations

- This is a **development toolkit** - not intended for production use as-is
- OAuth token storage is file-based (`schemas/token.json`) - secure this file
- The project uses environment variables - ensure `.env` is not committed
- MCP server configurations may contain sensitive paths - review before sharing

## Security Updates

Security updates will be announced via:

- GitHub Releases
- Repository Security Advisories
- Commit messages tagged with `[SECURITY]`
