## Understanding aiwebengine Scripts

### Key Concept: Server-Side Handlers

aiwebengine scripts are **server-side JavaScript** that handle HTTP requests:

**Scripts ARE:**

- ✅ Server-side request handlers
- ✅ Functions that return HTML/JSON/text
- ✅ API endpoints
- ✅ Web page generators

**Scripts are NOT:**

- ❌ Client-side browser JavaScript
- ❌ Static HTML files
- ❌ Standalone web pages

### Correct Prompts for Different Scenarios

#### Web Pages

```text
Create a script that serves a welcome page at /welcome

Create a homepage with navigation, hero section, and footer

Create a contact page with a form
```

#### APIs

```text
Create a REST API for managing todo items

Create an API endpoint that returns user data as JSON

Create a search API that accepts a query parameter
```

#### Forms

```text
Create a feedback form with GET handler (show form) and POST handler (process submission)

Create a file upload handler that stores images
```

#### Real-time Features

```text
Create a real-time chat system using Server-Sent Events

Create a live notification feed using streaming

Create a dashboard that updates every 5 seconds
```

## Prompt Examples by Use Case

### 1. Simple Web Page

**Prompt:**

```text
Create a script that serves an "About Us" page with company information,
team members, and contact details
```

**Expected Result:**

- Handler function returning HTML
- Route registered at `/about`
- Properly formatted HTML with CSS

### 2. REST API

**Prompt:**

```text
Create a REST API for a product catalog with:
- GET /api/products - list all products
- GET /api/products?id=X - get single product
- POST /api/products - create new product
- PUT /api/products - update product
- DELETE /api/products - delete product
Include input validation and error handling
```

**Expected Result:**

- Multiple handler functions
- All CRUD operations
- Validation logic
- Error responses

### 3. Form Processing

**Prompt:**

```text
Create a newsletter signup form that:
- Shows form on GET /signup
- Processes submission on POST /signup
- Validates email format
- Stores email in a list
- Shows confirmation message
```

**Expected Result:**

- GET handler with form HTML
- POST handler with validation
- Data storage
- Success/error responses

### 4. External API Integration

**Prompt:**

```text
Create a weather API that:
- Accepts city name as query parameter
- Fetches data from OpenWeather API using the fetch() function
- Formats and returns weather data as JSON
- Handles API errors gracefully
```

**Expected Result:**

- Handler with `fetch()` call
- API key handling (using secrets)
- Error handling
- Data transformation

### 5. Authentication

**Prompt:**

```text
Create a login system that:
- Shows login form on GET /login
- Processes credentials on POST /login
- Uses the built-in authentication functions
- Returns session token on success
- Redirects to dashboard after login
```

**Expected Result:**

- GET and POST handlers
- Auth API usage
- Session management
- Redirect logic

## AI Development Workflows

### Workflow 1: Rapid Prototyping

1. **Describe feature** to AI

   ```text
   Create a blog homepage that lists recent posts with titles,
   excerpts, and publish dates
   ```

2. **Review generated code**
   - Check the diff preview
   - Verify it matches requirements

3. **Apply and test**
   - Click "Apply Changes"
   - Test the endpoint immediately

4. **Iterate with AI**

   ```text
   Add pagination to the blog list

   Add a search feature

   Style the blog with modern CSS
   ```

### Workflow 2: Incremental Enhancement

1. **Start with working code**
   - Have a basic script running

2. **Ask AI for specific improvements**

   ```text
   Add error handling to all database operations

   Add logging to track API usage

   Add input validation for all form fields
   ```

3. **Review changes**
   - See side-by-side diff
   - Verify only intended changes

4. **Apply iteratively**
   - Accept changes one at a time
   - Test after each change

### Workflow 3: Learning and Exploration

1. **Ask AI to explain concepts**

   ```text
   How do I implement real-time updates using streams?

   Show me an example of file upload handling

   How do I call external APIs securely?
   ```

2. **Request examples**

   ```text
   Create a simple example of Server-Sent Events

   Show me how to use the fetch() function with API keys
   ```

3. **Build on examples**

   ```text
   Expand this SSE example to broadcast chat messages

   Add error handling to this fetch example
   ```

### Workflow 4: Debugging and Fixing

1. **Identify the issue**
   - Script returns errors
   - Unexpected behavior
   - Check logs for error messages

2. **Ask AI for help**

   ```text
   This script is throwing "undefined is not a function" errors.
   Here's the error from logs: [paste error]

   This form handler isn't receiving POST data correctly

   The streaming endpoint disconnects after 30 seconds
   ```

3. **Review proposed fixes**
   - AI shows what changes would fix the issue

4. **Apply and verify**
   - Test the fix
   - Check logs to confirm resolution

## Best Practices with AI

### 1. Iterate, Don't Expect Perfection

Start with a basic request, then refine:

```text
Step 1: "Create a user registration API"
Step 2: "Add email validation"
Step 3: "Add duplicate email checking"
Step 4: "Add password strength requirements"
Step 5: "Add rate limiting for registration attempts"
```

### 2. Review All AI-Generated Code

- **Always review** before applying
- **Test thoroughly** after applying
- **Understand** what the code does
- **Customize** to your specific needs

### 3. Be Specific About Technology

```text
Use the aiwebengine fetch() function to call the API

Use Server-Sent Events (routeRegistry.registerStreamRoute) for real-time updates

Use the built-in console.log() for logging

Reference the /style.css asset for styling
```

### 4. Provide Examples When Possible

```text
Create a form handler similar to the feedback example,
but for product reviews with a 1-5 star rating
```

### 5. Break Complex Requests into Steps

Instead of:

```text
Create a full e-commerce site with products, cart, checkout, and payment
```

Do this:

```text
Step 1: Create a product listing API
Step 2: Add product detail pages
Step 3: Create shopping cart functionality
Step 4: Add checkout form
Step 5: Integrate payment processing
```

## Using AI Outside the Editor

### ChatGPT / Claude / Other AI Assistants

You can use external AI tools by providing context:

**Context to provide:**

```text
I'm developing scripts for aiwebengine, which is a JavaScript-based
web application engine. Scripts are server-side handlers that:

- Receive a `req` object with method, path, query, form, headers
- Must return an object with status, body, contentType
- Use routeRegistry.registerRoute(path, handlerName, method) to map routes
- Can use console.log(message) for logging
- Can use fetch(url, options) for external API calls
- Can use routeRegistry.registerStreamRoute(path) and routeRegistry.sendStreamMessage(data) for SSE

Available functions:
- routeRegistry.registerRoute(), console.log(), listLogs(), listLogsForUri()
- fetch(), routeRegistry.registerStreamRoute(), routeRegistry.sendStreamMessage()
- assetStorage.listAssets(), assetStorage.fetchAsset(), assetStorage.upsertAsset(), assetStorage.deleteAsset()

Can you help me create a [your request]?
```

### GitHub Copilot / VS Code AI Tools

If developing locally with VS Code:

1. Create a `README.md` in your scripts directory explaining the aiwebengine APIs
2. Use Copilot with inline comments:

   ```javascript
   // Create a handler that returns a list of users as JSON
   function usersHandler(req) {
     // Copilot will suggest implementation
   }
   ```

### API-Specific AI Prompts

For external API integrations:

```text
Create an aiwebengine script that calls the Stripe API to process payments.
Use the fetch() function with {{secret:stripe_key}} for the API key.
Return JSON responses.
```

## Troubleshooting AI Assistance

### AI Generates Client-Side Code

**Problem:** AI creates browser JavaScript instead of server handlers

**Solution:** Be explicit:

```text
Create a SERVER-SIDE aiwebengine script that RETURNS HTML,
not client-side JavaScript
```

### AI Suggests Unsupported Features

**Problem:** AI uses Node.js/browser APIs not available in QuickJS

**Solution:** Specify:

```text
Use only QuickJS-compatible code. Available functions are:
routeRegistry.registerRoute(), console.log(), fetch(), JSON.parse(), JSON.stringify()
```

### AI Generates Too Much Code

**Problem:** Response is overwhelming or too complex

**Solution:** Ask for simpler version:

```text
Create a minimal working example of [feature]

Simplify this to just the essential functionality

Break this into smaller, focused functions
```

### AI Doesn't Understand Context

**Problem:** AI doesn't know about your existing code

**Solution:** Provide context:

```text
I have a script that manages users. Add a new endpoint to
delete users. Here's my current code: [paste code]
```
